# RPS-Multiplayer
## What this project does:
This project allows two users to play a game of rock, paper, scissors against one another in seperate browser windows.
## Why the project is useful:
This game is intended for entertainment purposes.  It allows users to face one another in the game rather than facing a randomly generated move.
## How users can get started:
On loading the webpage, enter your name into the text input field.  Then, select a move and hit submit.  A message will appear confirming your submission.  If your opponent has made a move, a message appears letting you know that they are ready. After both players have hit submit, the results will be displayed along with a button to play again.  The results are tallied in the upper left corner of the game.
## Where users can get help:

## Who maintains and contributes to this project:
Currently all work done on this project has been done by Nathan Niesel
